This project goal is create extensible prerequisite checking system for uni (and maybe compat with other job)

by create function for each condition and maybe middleware for manipulate data before usage (well.. middleware are already handled by express)

It's like mini framework for prerequisite haha

It's a good place to practice my config skill too. I config TypeScript, Prettier, ESLint, Webpack in this project by myself! (with help from internet obviously)
